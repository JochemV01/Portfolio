Much like the exploratory sketching course, exploratory making is also about exploring ideas as they come up and creating a final presentable version. However, they key difference is that this is with materials, in 3D. In this course, I learned to create actual models from foam core (3mm thick foam sandwhiched in layers of paper) and 1mm thick cardboard materials. Not only the shape and feeling could be explored, but also actual interactions by making mechanisms. Sliding, rotating, pushing, turning, opening, many things are possible. To go even further, electronics and various kinds of motors were also implemented in the models to make them actually interactive and expressive.

Much like exploring by sketching, exploring by making is a very useful skill to have for design. Although making is not as fast as sketching, some things simply cannot be sketched. Sketches can't be felt, you can't move anything or explore any motions. Besides the exploration part, the ability to create actual working models of designs on a high level will be very useful. I have already used the skills (and tools) gained from this course in my final bachelor project to create an exploratory prototype, and I am sure I will have many more opportunities to do so. I got to buy some more material and scalpel blades soon though.

During this course, I made some simple models to learn how to make different shapes, and simple mechanisms to learn those as well. Then, I explored and created a rich interaction light controller, an interactive and expressive useless machine (it's cute!) and finally a rich interaction hot beverage vending machine. Pictures and videos of all of these models can be found below.
