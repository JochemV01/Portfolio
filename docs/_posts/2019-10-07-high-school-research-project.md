In the final year of high school (VWO), we had to conduct an individual research project on a subject of our own choosing. In Dutch, this is called "eindwerkstuk". I chose the subject "Alternate fuels for cars" and focussed on the behavior change needed to switch from fossil fueled cars to electric or hydrogen vehicles.

My research and therefor the paper, consists of two parts: A more theoretical part about how the different technologies work including their pros and cons, and a more practical part where I created and analyzed a questionnaire which was filled in by 147 respondents. This second part was the main part of my project.

## Findings
To quickly summarize my findings at that time: It seemed more likely for electric cars to become wide-spread, mainly because of the convenience of changing at home and the already existing infrastucture for power. Another big reason is it being the most energy-efficient and thus cheapest option in use, not considering the production of the vehicle. High-pressured Hydrogen does not have an infrastucture, but nevertheless it is still a great option for clean transportation of bigger vehicles like cargo trucks.
