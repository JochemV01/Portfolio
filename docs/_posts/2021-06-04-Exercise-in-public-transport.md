In project 1, our design was about exercising in trains and on stations, by making this fun using gamification. Our design concept covers two locations: The train station and the train itself. On the train platform, there would be a location with multiple screens and a 3D-camera to track the player's motion, they can play the game by physically moving their bodies. For in the train, we designed a footpad which allows for multiple different motions along with a display to show the game. In this case, the player can control the game by making the proper motion with their feet. The more active the users are, the more points they will earn in the app, which can be spent on discounted trips or other items. We created a prototype of this app in Figma, it can be accessed below here.

Additionally, for our final prototype, we decided to create an interactive video to properly explain our concept and let the viewer experience it up to a certain amount. This was deemed the best option at the time, given the online education during the Covid-19 lockdowns. Since we would obviously not be able to install screens in trains and on train stations, these needed to be added to the video afterwards, through video editing. I had very limited experience with video editing, but learned a lot about motion tracking, masking and color keying until I was able to transform our ides into a video. It was made interactive by making multiple shorter videos and offering a couple of choices after each video. For example: Do you want to play game A or game B? Or do you take the stairs or the escalator at the train station? By making this video, I learned so many things about video editing and got much faster at it in general, which will forever be very useful whenever I need to make a video. It has proven to be very useful multiple times already, for example when I designed a [music sharing device](https://youtu.be/0ehKKDhynrA) for Aesthetics of Interaction. The interactive video for this project can be seen below.
