For the course "Aesthetics of Interaction", I designed an interactive speaker and handheld device to make exchanging songs a more enjoyable experience. The handheld device functions as the personal playlist, the idea is that both people have one. Songs can be pushed from the playlist into the speaker. If both people add a song to the speaker, it will start playing and if someone likes the song, they can add it to their playlist by pulling it out of the speaker with their device. The full concept can be seen in the [video](https://youtu.be/0ehKKDhynrA):

The point was to create a physical interactive experience. When sharing music, it's like sharing a part of your personality. Therefore, both people need to input a song to share before any songs will be played. Furthermore, when spending some time listening to songs I didn't know, I noticed that I found songs I already know more enjoyable. To make songs slightly more familiar the first time, I figured it would be nice to make a visualisation of the song which is being played. That way, when hearing it for the first time, you can already "see" some things coming. The protrusion from the handheld device and indentation in the speaker clearly show where the device should be held when "injecting" a song into the speaker. The full process, including the previous iterations, can be read in a short 2-page report using the button below.
