This is an elective every Industrial Design student has done (surely), I am no exception. And I am very glad I did, because this course is incredibly useful. I went from not being able to sketch or draw at all to feeling confident I can sketch my ideas both to explore them and to communicate them. This was also the goal of this course: Learning how to construct sketches, first to explore different ideas as they come up and later to present and communicate the best of those ideas. 

Starting from simple rectangular products, to circular products, combined ones and later complex shapes, bit by bit I learned how to "construct" a sketch. This gave me a point to start from, steps to follow, which is the thing I needed. I learned how to construct objects of various shapes in 3-point perspective. I learned how to explore through sketching, by immedeately skething any ideas as soon as they come up. Immedeately seeing them in front of me allows me to make rapid improvements and changes to the design. I learned how to apply line weight to create a sense of fore- and background, and finally how to make a convincing presentation out of the sketch. These are techniques I already applied in multiple of my projects, and which I will value forever. 

The remainder of this page shows some the sketches I made during the course, ordered from most recent to oldest.
