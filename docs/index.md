## Hi there, I'm Jochem Verstegen
I am an Industrial Design student at [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en/our-university/departments/industrial-design/), currently I'm in my final year of the master. I am passionate about smart technology and designing to help people understand complex systems and adopt new technologies.

Welcome to my portfolio! On this website, you can find many of the projects I did, my development as a designer, and my future plans.
