Do you want to use [Google's Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com) in your project, you might have noticed that when exporting a model, some example `HTML` and `JavaScript` code is already provided. This is nice, however, it is written to be used with a webcam. If you want to use upload a file to be processed by the model instead, you will have to code it yourself. Without a lot of experience in JavaScript, this can be difficult. Which is why I made this guide, including an example file, to make it easier for others to implent this into their projects.

To use Teachable Machine in your project: You need a couple of things. First and formost, you need a purpose, which I cannot help you with. But to give you a simple idea: It is possible to link a button to a specific page depending on the output of the model. In fact, this tutorial will show you how to do that. You also need to train and export a model, which is very simple. Finally, you need a webpage which allows for a file to be uploaded, which can be processed by your model.

<!-- This tutoral consists of two parts: [Exporting the model]({% model.md %}) and [coding the webpage]({% coding.md %}). -->
