# Hi! I'm Jochem.
I just submitted my FMP titled "Conversational User Interface for Brainstorming and Implementing Smart Home Automations." I followed the Research, Design and Development track during my Master's at [TU/e ID](https://www.tue.nl/en/our-university/departments/industrial-design/). I'm passionate about smart homes and aim to simplify and enrich interaction with IoT systems through iterative design.

This website showcases my Industrial Design portfolio, organized into: past (leading to my FMP), present (my FMP reflection), and future (my post-FMP plans). You can also find my Professional Identity and Vision.

> Note to assessors: Linked deliverables serve as supplementary material and are not required reading or counted in the word limit.

## Note on AI usage
After writing the portfolio, I used ChatGPT to shorten the text within the word limit. I adjusted the shortened text to be complete and correct where needed.
