In my [final bachelor project]({% post_url 2023-06-15-Slideo %}), I aimed to do a successful project while making sure to pay attention to my own development as a designer. As I described in my professional identity, I am someone who wants to keep doing different things. That is one of the main reasons why I chose to do a project in this squad: It is different from the previous projects I have done so there are plenty of new things for me to learn. Another reason is my personal interest in automated vehicles. The novelty and modernness of them is intriguing to me, so to do a project about this sounds interesting.

Throughout my project, I made sure to keep working on my development. More about this process, and the relevant expertise areas for each step, can be found on the page about the project by clicking [here]({% post_url 2023-06-15-Slideo %}).

Overall, I am pretty satisfied with my development during the project. I discovered how to use business-related methods to keep a design relevant and feasible, while still being innovative. Also, my first experience with 3D printing was a major milestone to me, as this opens up many more prototyping opportunities in the future. It was also nice for me personally, as I always enjoy to try out new technologies and this was my first time trying out something like 3D printing
