When making a model, you want to export it in the default mode. This means the model will be hosted by Google, all you need is the URL. You could copy the code provided by Google if you want to use it with a webcam, but if you want to use it with a file upload you can use my example code instead, which is available on a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/JochemV01/Teachable_Machine) and is explained on [this page](/coding).

> If you want to use Teachable Machine to change the webpage a certain button link to, as is explained in this tutorial, you need to make sure that the classnames in the model you trained correspond with the names of the HTML files you want to open. For example, if the model has three classes ("red", "green" and "blue"), you need your HTML files to be named `red.html`, `green.html` and `blue.html`.
