I aim to pursue a career in smart home design, enhancing the intuitiveness of IoT systems. Ideally, I hope to continue this path at Signify, where I’ve had a strong start. I seek a role as UX designer, but not exclusively focused on digital products. Smart homes are made up of physical products that are often controlled through digital interfaces, but still benefit from physical controls.

Staying updated on innovations, I’ll continue to explore and use creative approaches to explore emerging use cases and rich interactions that make complex systems accessible and engaging. Besides learning about new innovations, I aim to continue to learn about existing approaches as well as new approaches enabled by new innovations.

Through diverse projects at Industrial Design, I’ve become a flexible, adaptive designer, ready to tackle new challenges and technologies. As certain technologies develop and innovate, I will continue to adjust and refine my vision to stay up-to-date with the current state-of-the-art.
