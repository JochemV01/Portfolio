In the future, I plan to specialise in smart connected products, which can be (partially) physical or digital. My passion lies with smart home, and I think that market will grow extensively in the coming decades. Therefore, I plan to continue with my masters next year on the Research, Design and Development track, meaning my education will be more focused on the future career I am after.

My ideal job is one with a lot of diversity, where I get to work on different projects all the time. This will, as I expect, never get boring as there is always something new for me to do and learn. It is also a possibility for me to start my own company, if I end up getting such innovative ideas which don't fit in another company. But, I would prefer to work at a higher position in an existing company, where I still have enough freedom in my work.
