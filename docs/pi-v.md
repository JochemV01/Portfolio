title: Professional Identity and Vision

For my studies, I need to write a piece of text called my "professional identity and vision" and keep this updated constantly. It describes who I am as a designer and what my vision is for the future. Below, you can read the most recent version of my PI&V.

## Professional Identity
I have always been interested in smart products. Whenever something "new" comes out, I want to know everything about it. Seeing how technology can be used to improve the daily life and seeing how fast this technology is evolving is fascinating to me. Because of this, I see a lot of designs passing by and without realizing it I have come to the conclusion that design is more important than it might seem. It is not just about how something looks, feels and functions, it is about much more than that. Increasingly, I am starting to believe that design is about emotion and that, especially in the future, this could be a very relevant aspect to drastically improve a design.

Humans are emotional beings and often make choices based on their emotions, which is where subjectivity comes from. I believe people's subjective opinions can be affected through their emotions, by evoking certain emotional feelings. Feelings like surprise, happiness, frustration and confusion have an effect on someone's long-term attitude towards a product, service or brand, because they are related to emotions.

Currently, from what I have seen, smart products are not designed with emotion in mind. It is all about how it looks and works, a little about how it feels but not about what it means and does to you. However, brands do put some effort into affecting their customer's emotions through their marketing, although that's about their brand-image. So far, though being unaware of it at the time, I think I have tried to make some of my designs more emotionally aware, through aesthetics or choice of words. Although these are already important aspects when designing emotionally, I believe there are some other important ways of achieving this. For example, through movements, animations, sounds or haptic feedback. A multi-modal design is not only more functional, but it has the opportunity of being more emotional as well.

In a group, I can come up with creative ideas, which is something I have been getting better at over the years. Still, I am usually very realistic in thinking about if and how something would be possible. This has something to do with my passion of observing the consumer technology market, I have developed quite some knowledge this way and I tend to use it when I can. However, to be truly innovative, sometimes it is good to work with ideas that are not possible (yet). I am improving in that sense, but there is some more room to grow there.

## Vision
The future I envision is one where a lot of things will be automated for us. Driving a car for example will no longer be done by humans. Instead, the time traveling could be used to already do some work, or simply relax and watch a series.

Something that will also be getting increasingly important, is health and sustainability. Companies and products need to become more sustainable, but the general public also needs to make better choices, both for themselves and for their environment. In order to do that, they need to be able to choose, and making a better choice should not take more effort.

These two things can be combined, as automation can mean higher efficiency and with that better sustainability. Achieving more automation will require new products and systems, which immediately gives us the opportunity to design healthier and more sustainable ones.

Automations can also exist in the form of AI, which will be very common in the future. An AI will usually take away certain tasks from people in order to do it more safely, efficiently, more accurately or for any other reason, leaving room for humans to do more pleasant tasks. However, AI and automations in general need to be understood and sometimes controlled by anyone involved. I believe being in control will stay important for humans, so designers in the future will be tasked with making this possible. Also, designers should focus on making it understandable, which by my beliefs can be done using emotion.

Besides helping develop an understanding of the design on a deeper level, emotions can have the additional benefit of helping with wide-spread adoption. By forming opinions about the design based on emotions, the first opinions might be more positive than usual. In case of new technologies, like self-driving cars for example, it could be easier for the society to accept and adopt new technology.
